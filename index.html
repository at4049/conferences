        <h2>About IJCNN</h2>
        <p>IJCNN is the premier international conference in the area of neural networks theory, analysis and applications. Since its inception, IJCNN has been playing a leading role in promoting and facilitating interaction among researchers and practitioners, and dissemination of knowledge in neural networks and related facets of machine learning. And Rome with its history and geographical position will further contribute to grow and maintain the role of the IJCNN as a prominent platform for exchange of knowledge in neural networks and artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>IJCNN 2025 will be held in the year and the city of the Jubilee, making it an even more special occasion. Hosted at the Pontifical Gregorian University, just a coin's throw from the iconic Trevi Fountain, attendees will have the unique opportunity to experience Rome's rich history and culture. The Eternal City will serve as an open-air museum, providing an inspiring backdrop for our discussions and networking.</p>
        <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
        <p>
            The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare is burgeoning, with applications ranging from diagnostics to personalized treatment planning. However, the deployment of AI systems in clinical settings faces unique challenges, including data variability, model interpretability, and robustness against adversarial inputs. These issues align closely with IJCNN’s focus on neural networks and their real-world applications. There is a pressing need to address the gap between state-of-the-art AI research and its practical deployment in healthcare.
        </p>
        <p>
            The workshop directly addresses IJCNN’s mission of advancing neural network research with practical, high-impact applications. By focusing on robustness, this workshop aims to bridge the gap between theoretical AI advancements and their safe, reliable use in healthcare. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While previous workshops at conferences such as IJCNN 2023 and AAAI 2024 have explored AI in healthcare, these events typically concentrated on specific domains like medical imaging or drug discovery. This workshop is novel in its comprehensive focus on robustness, including adversarial resilience, fairness, and interpretability—critical attributes for clinical adoption.
